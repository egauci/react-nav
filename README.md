This is a basic left nav menu made with React, using jspm as the package manager.
It isn't meant for production use as is. I'm just playing with React.

Status: Initial Implementation done

To run:

1. git clone the repo
2. npm install -g jspm  (OS X/Linux will likely need sudo, Windows needs "run as admin")
3. cd to the folder
4. npm install
5. jspm install
6. Navigate to index.html in your browser
